## Projects Included

### üß© Custom Nodes: Comfyui_FSL_Nodes
- **manual_alpha_mask_painter.py**  
  Custom node to manually convert black mask areas into alpha transparency.  Useful with GRIPTAPE when inpainting and creating the mask by right clicking on the loaded image and select load mask editor.  Griptape requires an alpha channel mask.
- **8WayImgSwitch**
  Image switch with eight inputs
- **fsl_composite_with_mask_cropped.py**
  Designed to remove the Alpha Channel But Keep Transparent Parts as Background Color (not currently used)
- **fsl_save_and_strip_alpha**
  Strips alpha channel from RGBA image.  (not currently used)
- **FSLGeminiGenerateImageV6.py**
  Allows for the use of Gemini API's to create image.  This node also provide for whether or not the preceding image is used for iterative generation.  The dimension fields are just to support Metadata.  They do not effect the image.
- **fsl_image_memory.py**
  Provides 4 nodes.  Image Memory Store and Image Memory Recall stores an image to the key entered in the 'key' field.  Image memory recall recalls the image for subsequent use.  Image Memory Clear is used to delete the stored image based on the entered key.  Image Memory Clear All clears all keys that have been entered.
- **fsl_prompt_compose.py**
  Node for Positive and Negative prompt as well as 'scene-lock'.  When scene-lock is true -
  When lock_scene: True, the node prepends a short instruction block before your positive text that tells the model to treat the provided image as fixed ‚Äúscene layout‚Äù and only change what you explicitly ask. The included language (summarized) is:
    - use the provided image as base;
    - keep composition, subjects, positions, background, lighting, camera angle, clothing, colors unchanged;
    - change only what you specify;
    - do not crop, do not isolate a single subject, do not change the background.
- **fsl_ensure_nhwc_batch.py**
  Node guarantees that any incoming image tensor is converted to the [N, H, W, C] (batch‚Äìheight‚Äìwidth‚Äìchannels) layout expected by downstream nodes, automatically re-ordering dimensions and normalizing types so all image data conform to a consistent format for safe processing.
- **FSLImageSaverWithMetadataV5.py**
  Node stores metadata with image.  Data can be easily read using the LoadImage-w-Metadata.json workflow

### üé® Workflow: T-shirt Designer
- **Tshirt-Designer-ver_2.0.json**  
  It is recommended not to use this workflow.  A replacement workflow that is less complex will be uploaded as 3.0
  Workflow designed for generating masked transparent images for T-shirt and object printing.
- Many corrections and updates
- Full workflow details and notes are available in [`tshirt_designer/`](https://github.com/fredlef/comfyui_projects/tree/main/workflows/tshirt_designer).

### üé® Workflow: Nano Banana (An API is required)
- **Nano Banana Iterative-Base.json**
  Allows the user to create an image using Gemini-2.5 Flash-image-preview or Gemini-2.5 Flash.  Once the initial image is created additional iterations of each succeeding image can be created just be entering a new prompt.  Setup is included in a Note node in the workflow.
- **Nano Banana Iterative-Load 5 Images.json**
  Provides for using up to 5 nodes to create an image with Nano Banana.  The images can they be modified as in the Iterative-Base workflow. Basic instructions are provided in Notes nodes in the workflow.
- **Nano Banana w_Griptape w_Upscaler.json**
  Uses Griptape Nodes as a front end prompt loader to Nano Banana.  An excellent upscaler by Alex at ComfyUiStudio is included.  An OpenAPI Key is required.
- **Nano Banana img2img w_Griptape.json**
  Uses Griptape Nodes as a front end prompt loader to Nano Banana in support of image to image workflow.
- **Nano Banana img2img Base.json**
  Base workflow for image to image with Nano Banana.

### Miscellaneous Workflows
- **LoadImage-w-Metadata.json**
  Simple workflow to read the metadata created by the FSLImageSaverWithMetadataV5 node
